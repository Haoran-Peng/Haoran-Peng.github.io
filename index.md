# About me
I received my Ph.D. degree (Honors, 杰出毕业生) in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (previouly National Chiao Tung University) in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Li-Chun Wang](https://wang.web.nycu.edu.tw/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, I was a full-time software engineer and launched a tech startup with my friends and classmates. Unfortunately, it didn't succeed. <br>

I did a visiting research at Rochester Institute of Technology in the summer of 2021, advised by [Prof. Shanchieh Yang](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sjyeec-shanchieh-yang) and [Prof. Hanif Rahbari](http://rahbari.csec.rit.edu/).

<!-- **I am currently on the 2023 academic job market, looking for positions in ECE, CSE etc., related with Machine Learning, Optimization, with applications in Wireless Communications, Networking, CyberSecurity. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.** -->
