# About me
I am a postdoctoral research associate at *The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)* supervised by [Prof. Angela Yingjun Zhang](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree (Honors, 杰出毕业生) in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (previously National Chiao Tung University) in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Li-Chun Wang](https://wang.web.nycu.edu.tw/). Previously, I received my BEng degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, I was a full-time software engineer and launched a tech startup with my friends and classmates. Unfortunately, it didn't succeed. <br>

I did a visiting research at Rochester Institute of Technology in the summer of 2021, advised by [Prof. Shanchieh Yang](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sjyeec-shanchieh-yang) and [Prof. Hanif Rahbari](http://rahbari.csec.rit.edu/).

<!-- **I am currently on the academic job market, looking for faculty positions in ECE, CSE, etc., related to Machine Learning and optimization, with applications in Wireless Communications, Networking, and CyberSecurity. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.** -->

# Research Interests

I have developed a particular interest in ***Machine Learning for Wireless Communications***, on which I have published several related articles.
