# About me
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Li-Chun Wang](https://wang.web.nycu.edu.tw/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, I was a full-time software engineer in Chengdu. <br>

I did a visiting research at Rochester Institute of Technology in the summer of 2021, advised by [Prof. Shanchieh Yang](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sjyeec-shanchieh-yang) and [Prof. Hanif Rahbari](http://rahbari.csec.rit.edu/).

<!--**I am currently on the 2022-2023 academic job market, looking for postdoc positions in ECE, CSE etc., related with Machine Learning, Optimization, with applications in Wireless Communications, Networking, CyberSecurity. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.**-->

# Research Interests

I have developed a particular interest in the field of ***Machine Learning for Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing***, on which I have published several related articles.
